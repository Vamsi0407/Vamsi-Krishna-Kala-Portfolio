        <h4>Mobile gaming</h4>
        <p>These are games which I regularly play on my mobile and occasionally I do play PC and console gaming.</p>
        <p>Apart from these I also do play games which are newly launched in mobiles and see how the game is performing
            on a daily basis for a normal user and an intense user. This is not my livelyhood but I love to do that!!!
