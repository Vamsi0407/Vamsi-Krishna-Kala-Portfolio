            <h4>Experience</h4>
            <p> But before that, I started my career as a support executive at
                Examity India Online Proctoring LLP on May 2019. I have worked there for two and half years where I used to 
            support international students in logging in to their test portal and starting the test. I have handled inbound 
            calls from the students and also chats to resolve the technical issues that they were having in starting the 
            test or making the payment to schedule a test. I had good hands-on with salesforce lightning as a main tool
            for the tickets and also worked with Jira to inform the development or the core tech team about any technical glitch
            or any possible errors on the student portal. That was my first experience with real-world scenarios and then I ended my
            journey with the organization on December 2022</p>

        <p>Now I am currently working with Tech Mahindra LTD. as a Sr. Customer Support Associate and here is another 
            journey of my career started. Here I am working as a warranty analyst for a renowned motorsports industry based
            in Canada. Here I am working with the claim and cases where the main platform I was working on is salesforce lightning
            and SAP S/4. So here my daily routine will be like assisting the dealers to know the process of filing a warranty claim.
            Navigate through the dashboards and help them to check if there are any errors on the main dashboard and immediately 
            report them back to my manager and inform the dealers once the issue is resolved. My main mode of communication is via cases
            on salesforce. 
        </p>
        
        <p>In this organization, I also have worked with different teams such as the admin team where I used to check the accounts
            for the dealer's profiles and set up the dealer's profiles via profile management on SAP. And also I was included 
            with the training team to help the team with the training modules and also creating work templates and considering 
            quality measurements.
        </p>

       <h4>Skills and Self-development</h4>
       <p>
        I love to work in a complete tech environment so I started learning about coding and as a part of that 
        I joined a course namely CS50 Web Development from Harvard University where I am currently learning the concepts
        of web development with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, Python, etc... And there were different projects assigned
        in this course to test our understanding. As a part of that, I was able to replicate the google home page as a basic project 
        using HTML and CSS and in this stage, I also got the concepts on bootstrap. And this is just the starting stage and 
        I wanted to test myself so started creating my portfolio and adding some features which I have learned. Now getting my hands on
        other concepts such as Python, Django, Javascript, SQL, My SQL, UI, Testing, Scalability, and Security, etc...
